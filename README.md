No special actions should be required for compiling this project. Just run the uninformed_search.py file in your terminal to start the program.
Several starting positions have been included in the analysis report, and can be loaded into the program by pasting them into the "load" function of the program. The search algorithms may be run on any position by using the "bfs" and "dfs" commands.
